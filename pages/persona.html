                    <ul>
                        <li>Sally owns a small start-up and spends all her time finding new clients or working alongside her team of designers.</li>
                        <li>Her passion and focus is on good design and she gets frustrated when business needs distract her from that.</li>
                        <li>She needs a simple, reliable way to share project files with her team with as few technical hurdles as possible.</li>
                        <li>She wants to make sure all company project assets are backed up and stored securely.</li>
                        <li>She would much rather pay monthly for a cloud service with tech support, than spend the time and resources to hire someone to build a custom cloud storage solution.</li>
